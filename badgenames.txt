                    Appropriately-Formed Badge Names
                             draft-afbd-00

Abstract

   With the proliferation of badge names amongst our networks, it is
   important to think to the future - there are badge names all around
   us, and yet many badge endpoints do not support a full-subset of
   features expected by many badge holders in this workgroup
   (limitations to length, for example): therefore, a standard by which
   to evalutate the quality of any particular badge name is to be
   established by this document.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Length limitations

   The length of a badge name is critical in determining its
   compatibility with any badge endpoint.  Any particular badge endpoint
   may limit badge names to a paltry 20 characters total, so it is
   advised to keep names as short as possible.

1.2.  General form

   A well-formed badge may take the following form:

   <adjective> <noun>

   Deviations from this form are permitted, but highly discouraged as
   this tends to lead to excessively long badge names, incompatible with
   many endpoints.
